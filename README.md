# basic_seed_chainer

Experiments for TODO by implementing a basic seed-chain-extend algorithm with sketching in rust. The program generates a random string,
a mutated version of the random string with error rate theta, and aligns them via seed-chain-extend. 

### Requirements 

1. [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and associated tools such as cargo are required and assumed to be in PATH.
